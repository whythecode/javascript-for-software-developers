/**
 * 1. Add 2 other list items to the list with the ID 'list-with-id'. For example, with the content 'F' and 'G'.
 */


/**
 * 2. Then, delete the first two ('A' and 'B') items of the list.
 */


/**
 * 3. Add an event listener to each list item, so that when clicked, the word "click" is added to the text.
 */


/**
 * 4. Now, when clicking on each list item, also trigger an event called 'custom:my-click' on that same element.
 */


/**
 * 5. Listen for the 'custom:my-click' at the 'list-with-id'. Whenever it's fired, add another item to the list.
 */


/**
 * 6. Improve the functionality from exercises 3 and 4, so that the 'click' event listener is only added once instead
 * of to every list item individually.
